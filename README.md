# Sudoku-Solver

This is my solution to the problem of making an algorithm solve a Sudoku board.
The solution includes a back-tracking approach to solve this problem.

Backtracking:
-------------
  Backtracking is an recursive way of solving problems where the solution is built in small increaments, one increament at a time. Instead of trying all the possible values, this approach, when fails backtracks to the last successful step and changes the value of the next step to further the solution.
  
Another solution to this problem can be an iterative model where all the possible numbers are tried at all the empty positions.
However, this approach takes a lot of time and is not the most ideal way to find the correct solution.
